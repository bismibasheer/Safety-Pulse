# Safety-Pulse
"Safety Pulse" is a web-based platform aimed at reducing accidents by allowing users to report rule violations. It involves five key stakeholders: admin, users, subadmin, MVD, and RTO. The system encourages public participation to support better enforcement of traffic rules and promote safer roads.
